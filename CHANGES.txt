- Increased default number of coarse axial intervals from 9 to 27. Small
  impact on performance (~10%)

- Simplified the transport sweep. We were previously doing a forwards and
  backwards setup as is often done in MOC. However, for 3D MOC, this doesn't
  have much benefit anymore especially due to the more computationally intense
  quadratic source. Note that this change does not alter performance
  significantly, as it doesn't touch the inner "attenuate fluxes" function.
