- Changed the axial interval calculation to an actual ceil() funciton call
  so it doesn't trip static code analyzers. No performance impacts expected.

NEW IN VERSION 3
===============================================================================

- Increased default number of coarse axial intervals from 9 to 27. Small
  impact on performance (~10%)

NEW IN VERSION 2

- Simplified the transport sweep. We were previously doing a forwards and
  backwards setup as is often done in MOC. However, for 3D MOC, this doesn't
  have much benefit anymore especially due to the more computationally intense
  quadratic source. Note that this change does not alter performance
  significantly, as it doesn't touch the inner "attenuate fluxes" function.
